# Terrain Generation and Flocking Simulation

A school project where I implemented Perlin Noise to generate a 3D patch of terrain, and implemented Craig Reynolds' Steering Behaviours to create a flock simulation. 

This project was done in Unity3D, a game development software. To view the simulation, clone this repository and open it in Unity. 

Most of the scene is generated with C# scripts found in Assets/Scripts. Aswell, there is a terrain shader script in Assets/Shaders.
